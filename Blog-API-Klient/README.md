This is a list of files for a blog application that I have completed for my web communication project at JensenYh. The first function is that it "fetches" blog post from the API: : 
https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts and displays blog posts ( the first 100 characters) made by my classmates and myself.

**Note to reader: The GitRespitory is a bit chaotic due to not getting the "hang" of GitHub just yet. I had to start a new one well into my project because of having technical problems**

**Other funcationaly:** An ability to see more of a specific post when "read more" is clicked (GET: https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**The ability to return either to the blog page or admin page from viewing the full blog entry** 

**A link to an admin index** (in a seperate folder titled admin where you see posts title, names, tags, deletion and editing of blog emtry)

**The ability to create a post by using a seperate admin section** after this function is used it returns you back to the admin index There is also a "Regret" link that turns the user back to the admin panel instead of creating a new post ( https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts)

**The ability to delete a specific post** from the admin panel with an alert asking the user if they "really want to delete" a apecific blog entry and then returns the user to the admin panel
(https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**The ability to update posts by clicking on the update button.** After update then returns to the admin panel (https://blog-api-assignment.up.railway.app/posts/)

**Easy navigation** There is always links on each page or an alert eindow so the user always allows the user to return to another page.

**Both the update and create areas have a multi select of tags by holding ctrl+left mouse click** 

**The HTML is stylized by bootstrap due to it's ability to have a more cohesive and better user friendly layout**

**This application has comments on each file for easy tracking of how I was thinking in the process of coding**
